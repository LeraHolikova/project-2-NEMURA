# NEMURA

It's our second project at Wild Code School that we created in a month's time. We used all our knowledge of React, JavaScript, and CSS. It was possible to implement that with the API from www.tvmaze.com.

## General info

This website allows you to search for any TV show and get information about its actors/actresses, seasons/episodes as well as its description. The nicest thing is the rating, so it's easy to see if the exact TV show is worth watching. 

## Features

* "Search bar" is where you can search for an exact TV show
* "My Favourites" page is created to allow you to save your favourite TV shows in one place
* "Top 50 series" - if you don't know what to watch, you can look for top-rated TV shows of all times
* "Quotes" are there to display every time a new quote from a random TV show 
* "NEMURA's TOP" was added to make our website more unique by displaying TV shows based on our recommendations

The design we used matches all resolutions and screen sizes.
